PayStub calculator

The program will take in an employees wage and hours and calculate weekly/biweekly/annual pay. By implementing text fields and buttons we plan on being able to show the consumer what they will be earning so they can plan for the future. It will work by the user imputing wages and hours and behind the scenes we will calculate the rest so the user can sit back and relax. After text fields are inputted the user will be prompted with their pay for the weekly/biweekly/annual.


V1- So far we have a couple of text fields that we are planning to implement as well as a menubar with some functions working and some still needing to be implemented. Frame is looking good and so far no issues with what we plan on doing for V2.

V2- Get the calculations worked out and hopefully printing to the screen as well as finishing/polishing the text and menu options.
